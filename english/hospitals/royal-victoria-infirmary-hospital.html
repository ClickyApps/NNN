                <strong>SCBU Dads Team</strong> <br />
                The SCBU Dads Team is the 1st of its kind in the UK, a support group specifically for Dads, who either
                have babies currently in the SCBU, or who have had babies previously in the Unit. The team aims to bring
                these two groups of dads together, meeting informally, at the hospital once a month. The dads get an
                opportunity to chat about their shared experiences of having a baby on the ward. It’s a completely
                relaxed setting, and there’s absolutely no expectation or requirements from the dads. It’s just a safe
                space to talk about the dad’s experience of having a baby in special care. By talking in confidence with
                other dads, they will get valuable insight, encouragement and support from people who’ve been in your
                shoes. Further information about the team, is available on posters throughout Ward 35 at the RVI, or can
                be obtained by asking the nurse caring for your baby, or any member of the neonatal team. Hope that as a
                dad of a baby on our unit you will be able come along. <br /><br />
